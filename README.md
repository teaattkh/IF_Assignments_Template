Here is a template on how to format your IF assignments, including folder structure, naming conventions, and expectatations per assignment, as the structure may vary

## Remember to Commit After Each Exercise
Your `.git` file should be in your root folder. Per each exercise, create a folder for the appropriate files (i.e. index.html, style.css, main.js, etc). Then return to the parent folder, run an `git status` command to ensure your files have been saved and are ready for staging, commiting, and pushing.
