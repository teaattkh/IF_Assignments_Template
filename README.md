# IF_Assignments_Template
Here is a template on how to format your IF assignments, including folder structure, naming conventions, and expectatations per assignment, as the structure may vary

## Remember to Commit After Each Exercise
Your `.git` file should be in your root folder. Per each exercise, create a folder for the appropriate files (i.e. index.html, style.css, main.js, etc). Then return to the parent folder (in this case, that's `IF_Assignment_Template`, run an `git status` command to ensure your files have been saved and are ready for staging, committing, and pushing.

As you continue through your Innovation Fellowship, you will be creating new exercise folders, adding files, and pushing to Git on the fly!

**This will also serve as a consolidated space for your assignments, so that they are easily located, formatted, and organized.**

## Check formatting
Your folder structure and naming conventions should follow the same pattern per the assignment in this template

> For example, `week 1` contains multiple subjects with a number of exercises. As such, assignments will include the subject **and** exercise name.

>> `week_#_subject_exercise_#`

>So, the `week 1` folder contains `week_1_html_exercise_1`

## You may have other repos
This will serve well for *exercises*, however, for your dedicated portfolio work it is still recommended to have dedicated repos.

# IMPORTANT
**It is not recommended to have repos within repos.** Each repo will create a dedicated `.git` file in your folders. If you have a `.git` in a subfolder of another folder that already has a `.git`, you may encounter unnecessary obstactles. Please be advised to not create repos within repos.
